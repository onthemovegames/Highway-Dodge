# Highway-Dodge
This repo is for a written tutorial commissioned by Envato Tuts+. This tutorial covers how to create a highway dodge game using Corona SDK and the Lua programming language. This tutorial was originally posted under the name, That's So Panda, but I've moved my tutorials and code to Game Building Tools.

If you'd like to read how to create this game, please head on over to https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-highway-dodge-with-the-corona-sdk--cms-22829. I also recorded a short demo video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VttQY5zOpi8 to showcase the game.
